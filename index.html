      <h3> My Morning Routine</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>I tend to wake up naturally 7.5 hours after I have gone to bed, making my wake up time around 6:00am every morning.</li>

          <li>I will then make my bed, open my blinds, and make a <strong>double espresso.</strong></li>

          <li>4 days out of the week I will go to the gym for 7:00am. On days where I don't go, I will do some school work while listening to classical music.</li>

          <li>By 8:30am I will either be done at the gym, or wrapping up what I am working on and then make breakfast which is usually banana and peanut butter on toast</li>

          <li>Lastly, I will take a shower and get dressed for the rest of my day :)</li>
      </ol>

      <h3> What People Are Saying</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p> "I have been a morning person my entire life. My parents never gave me a curfew because I would always take myself to bed at a reasonable time, even when I was an unreasonable teenager. Therefore, I have no tips on being a better morning person.</p>
