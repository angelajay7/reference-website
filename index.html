      <h3> My Morning Routine</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>I tend to wake up naturally 7.5 hours after I have gone to bed, making my wake up time around 6:00am every
          morning.</li>

        <li>I will then make my bed, open my blinds, and make a <strong>double espresso.</strong></li>

        <li>4 days out of the week I will go to the gym for 7:00am. On days where I don't go, I will do some school work
          while listening to
          <a class=music href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3sw0t0icwozVoQP5J2Z8cX?si=dccef7132cd14849">classical
            music.</a>
        </li>

        <li>By 8:30am I will either be done at the gym, or wrapping up what I am working on and then make breakfast
          which is usually banana and peanut butter on toast</li>

        <li>Lastly, I will take a shower and get dressed for the rest of my day :)</li>
      </ol>

      <h3> What People Are Saying</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p> "I have been a morning person my entire life. My parents never gave me a curfew because I would always take
          myself to bed at a reasonable time, even when I was an unreasonable teenager. Therefore, I have no tips on
          being a better morning person.</p>

      <p> Ever since I was young my dad has told me:
        <q>You sleep like a <span style="color: saddlebrown">log</span>.</q>
      </p>
      <p>At any given point in the day, you can often find me with multiple beverages by my side. Here I have them
        listed along with how they benefit me.</p>

        <dt>Water:</dt>
        <dd>Hydration</dd>

      <p>There are lots of ways to change your text using html, for example the "b" tag is used to <b>bold</b> a
        specific piece of text, wheras the "i" tag will turn text of your choosing into <i>italics.</i> The "small" tag
        is used in cases where smaller text is needed, a common example of this being <small>copyright
          information</small> in the footer.
